        <p>Akwa Ibom is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It borders Cross River State to the
            east, Rivers
            State and Abia State to the west and north-west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The state takes its
            name from the
            Qua Iboe River which bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny.[4] Akwa Ibom was split from
            Cross River
            State in 1987. The state has 31 local government areas, and its capital is Uyo.</p>
